# 2020 Accenture ServiceNow Hackathon

First place for a COVID-19 response application developed using ServiceNow app development platforms. Our application, H Help, focuses on connecting those who lost their jobs due to COVID-19 with paid jobs helping others through small errands such as food delivery and cleaning. Application supports both mobile and desktop and has many possible features to be added in the future. 

**Client side:**

Mobile user experience with pop ups that explain fields.

Desktop user experience.

Javascript client scripts hide the "Other" form until "Other" is selected as a Job Type.

Matching is done by desired start and end date, job type, and location.

This repo contains a test application that uses ServiceNow to support an application for loaning and requesting items such as laptops and phones. 

This is not the project that we submitted to win first place in the competition, but instead something we created in the first half of the hackathon to familiarize ourselves with the framework.
