# 2020 Accenture ServiceNow Hackathon


This application uses ServiceNow to support an application for loaning and requesting items such as laptops and phones. 

This is not the project that we submitted to win the competition, but instead something we created in the first half of the hackathon to familiarize ourselves with the framework.
